BlenderCAM (fabex) and CadSketcher are "ports" of this plugin.  These happened because OS upgraded system python version to 3.12, however these plugins did not offer a 3.12 version, hence would not install and not run.  These were "hacked" to make them install on Python 3.12, desipte their binaries still being 3.11... USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  These may install, but may not work properly or at all... you have been warned.
